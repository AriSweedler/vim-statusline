# My statusline
This plugin is like airline. But faster, and only 80% as good. And written by me

It's contrived ahaha. But it's also the best.

# Installation
Install this using vim's built-in package support:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/AriSweedler/start
    cd ~/.vim/pack/AriSweedler/start
    git clone git@github.com:AriSweedler/vim-statusline.git sweedler-statusline
